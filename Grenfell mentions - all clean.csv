My thoughts and prayers are with all those who lost loved ones or suffered as a result of the fire. My gratitude also goes to our brave firefighters and emergency services who excelled in the most difficult of circumstances. As we come to terms with the aftermath of the fire, I wanted to let you know what I‚Äôll be doing as your local MP to ensure that this tragedy is not repeated elsewhere in the UK, particularly in Havant. It is right that this process starts with the independent public inquiry that has been ordered by the Prime Minister to investigate the causes of the fire. If this judge-led investigation finds that our fire safety rules surrounding tall buildings need to be strengthened, then I‚Äôll support appropriate action in Parliament.

Below is the full letter I have received from The Guinness Partnership, who own 168 flats in three high rise buildings in Leigh Park. While I‚Äôm thankful that none of the buildings have the same type of cladding as used at Grenfell Tower in London, I welcome the review by Guinness into fire safety and I have asked for a copy of their final report to be sent to me. Nationally, I fully support the announcement yesterday by the Government of a new independent expert advisory panel to advise on any immediate measures that can be put in place to make buildings safe. I have already met the Fire Minister and the Housing & Planning Minister about Grenfell and the actions we can take going forward.

I am advised that fire crews have now visited all our relevant buildings. They have carried out further risk assessments and provided reassurance to local residents. I am assured that there is no cause for concern and that the buildings are safe. Government Ministers also gave instructions that checks should be carried out on every high rise with similar cladding to that at Grenfell Tower. None are affected in Gloucestershire. Meanwhile, I attended a briefing in Parliament from ministers this afternoon, and the Prime Minister has ordered a full public inquiry. No stone must be left unturned in getting to the bottom of what happened in Grenfell Tower.

In that statement she indicated that other high rise blocks in the UK have been found to be using cladding, samples of which have been shown to be 'combustible'. More results will be made public in the next 48 hours. This was very concerning. My immediate thought, obviously, was for residents in Cheltenham. So, having spoken further to the county's Chief Fire Officer today, I can provide the following update: Cheltenham has zero high-rise buildings with similar cladding to Grenfell Tower. However, there are three medium-rise buildings that have been confirmed to use a different type of cladding, known as 'Rockwool'. I have indicated that core sampling and fire testing of this cladding must be carried out urgently. I am assured that arrangements are being made to do so.

It has been a busy one so far: catching up on Brexit, Syria, Yemen, the latest on school funding, free school meals, and in the middle of it all, asking the Prime Minister when she will publish Bishop James Jones' report on the experience of the Hillsborough families. Why does this matter? Because the Prime Minister herself asked Bishop James to report to her about the challenges faced by this amazing group of people who have dealt with the worst possible catastrophe, and then had to fight the state to be treated properly, and to see the truth come out. Presumably, she asked for this report because she thought there was something to learn. If so, those lessons are now urgent. I believe that there are still parts of the state that do not know how to treat people who are bereaved or who have survived catastrophe.

At the start of the meeting a representative from Rockwall, who are responsible for the insulation installed in the three tower blocks conducted a controlled demonstration of the Rockwall insulation. The representative from Rockwall explained that the material used is non-combustible and that no fire would be able to travel like seen in the tragic events at Grenfell. The representative showed the residents at the meeting that the material was non-combustible as they lit a blow torch, with a heat of 1,100 degrees, on the insulation for the duration of the meeting and it did not catch alight.

This is a disappointing development which suggests the government is not taking the issue of racial disparity within public services seriously. There is already a strong mistrust of the government which has been exacerbated by the shocking Grenfell fire tragedy, that is why the release of the report at this time is so important. The Prime Minister must immediately explain why the report will not be released this month as planned and provide assurances that the report will be published unamended in full. The Prime Minister said this report would not shy away from difficult truths but now the government appears to be doing just that.

Today, Muslims remember this story by carrying its message with them. A message of compassion for those less fortunate and of sharing what we have with others. These values are more relevant today than ever. We must come together in our communities and as a society to draw strength from our shared humanity. This year, I have travelled across the country and visited many mosques.

Over three decades of neoliberalism has created a wide-spread appetite for change to a degree that didn‚Äôt exist in the same way in the early 1980s. Unlike many of his peers, Corbyn was lucky enough to have never swallowed the pill of neoliberalism, while many of today‚Äôs younger generation, and those left behind by globalisation, have never seen the appeal. The zeitgeist has now shifted and with instances like Grenfell, people increasingly feel it in their bones that system change is desperately needed; these are the foundations for a Corbyn-led Labour government.""",Labour,Facebook,9,2017,09/2017,2017/09,J) Labour,#N/A,No cladding

Fire statistics released yesterday make for alarming reading: incidents have increased by 9 per cent compared to the previous year. The statistics include the catastrophic Grenfell Tower fire, which cost the lives of 71 people. The Fire Brigades Union describes it as the UK‚Äôs worst fire in terms of deaths within living memory. However, the government‚Äôs response is lacking on many fronts. As of last month, 299 of 312 high rise buildings with Grenfell-style cladding have failed safety tests, and only three of these buildings have completed cladding replacement. There are thousands of towers in social housing schemes, student accommodation and privately-owned blocks across the country in which residents will be sleeping uneasy for fear of a repeat of the Grenfell Tower disaster.

When tragedies such as Grenfell Tower occur, it is very easy to forget that domestic fire incidents and deaths have declined steadily and significantly over the last decade.

There were also powerful presentations on the theme by Blackpool and Fylde schools at the service. A special thanks to Stephen Conway from St Mary's Catholic College for coordinating the students so well.

Who could have foreseen a year ago that unexpected General Election, those shocking terrorist attacks on London & Manchester and the sheer human suffering of Grenfell Tower? As ever, it's been a year of contrasts. Locally, we have seen some good outcomes, like the re-opening of the Post Office in Welwyn Garden City and continued record falls in unemployment; meaning more people have jobs than ever before in our area. And, as we look to 2018, there's much more to be done here in Welwyn Hatfield. So I'll be launching the 'Make Healthcare Local' campaign, to try and convince health bosses that, with a growing population, we need more health services in our community; rather than miles away. And I'll be campaigning for the widening of the A1M Motorway, with 'Smart running' to reduce the queues at rush hour. But, of course, some of the most significant events of 2018 will also be the hardest to predict. So...",Conservative,Facebook,12,2017,12/2017,2017/12,A) Conservative,#N/A,No cladding

Carnival emerged as a response to bigotry and hatred faced by black communities. It united people through art, music and dance in celebration of Caribbean culture, black history and our diverse and multicultural society. This year's Carnival comes as we mourn the tragedy of the Grenfell Tower fire. This important event aims to help the local community to heal, as the very first Carnival did in the 1960s. Carnival-goers will not only celebrate Carnival, but also reflect on inequality and injustice in our society and resolve to work together to overcome them. The Carnival is beautifully captured in Benjamin Zephaniah's poem, Carnival Days: On days like these we dance to us, With the drum beat of liberation Under the close cover of European skies, We dance like true survivors We dance to the sounds of our dreams. ...

Promises to introduce a national education service and create new regional investment banks as the building blocks for a prosperous future. Promises of investment in our public services, and fair pay for public sector workers like police officers, firefighters and NHS staff. A commitment to decent housing for everyone - a particularly poignant promise as we remember the victims of the terrible fire in Grenfell Tower. Promises to end exploitative credit card interest costs, and to return essential services to public control. Jeremy Corbyn in his closing speech to conference also talked about our global commitments and responsibilities.

Kevin attended a meeting at Torquay Fire Station recently as well as speaking with senior council officials to seek the fire safety reassurance that his constituents rightly require. Parliament breaks up for the summer recess on Thursday 20th July, and Kevin has another week of DCLG and Grenfell - fire related meetings coming up.

People do it because they care, and also because they do not like to feel they cannot help, they want to wrap their arms around those who are suffering, they want to meet that unmet need. Today there is something you can do to help people in this way. It might help in the wake of the next attack, or incident, or it might help a new born baby with sickle cell, or a patient for surgery. You won't know, but you will make a massive difference. Please decide to register and give blood.

Leeds City Council have responded swiftly to concerns following the Grenfell Tower disaster - communicating with tenants and residents and testing all cladding - and assuring people that no blocks in Leeds use the cladding used in Kensington. However, LCC and many other local authorities need funds to pay for the installation of sprinkler systems, fire alarms and suitable cladding in all high rise flats - including the 26 blocks in Leeds West.

I campaigned for the blocks to be taken back under the control of Leeds City Council and I am glad that happened. It is a change that has undoubtedly improved the situation for tenants. However, the council‚Äôs work has been made harder due to relentless budget cuts under the Tories. Since 2010, the Tories have cut Leeds City Council‚Äôs core funding by ¬£214m.

The Council has responded with the following statement: ‚ÄúWe are deeply saddened by this morning‚Äôs tragic incident in London and our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected.

Since the tragedy happened at Grenfell House in West London they have been looking at fire safety in Edinburgh's high rise blocks. Everyone is anxious to make sure that such a horrific tragedy cannot happen again. There are 45 multi-storey blocks of flats in Edinburgh - housing about 4000 tenants. Of these, 16 are relatively modern and have not been refurbished. The remaining 29 have had works done including external cladding. Every single one of them was inspected last week and we were told that in no case were materials used which were the same as those in Grenfell. All the cladding and insulation panels are mineral based and non-combustible. I asked for a brief specific report on each individual block outlining construction method and material, fire safety procedures and recommendations for improvement.

Yvette Cooper,2017-07-04,https://www.facebook.com/YvetteCooperMP/posts/1343424405713032,"Following the Grenfell tower fire, I'm very concerned that there still hasn't been proper testing of insulation in other high rise blocks, which the police investigating the fire have said was ""more flammable than cladding"". I've raised this repeatedly with ministers and I don't understand why they aren't testing insulation in the same way as they are testing cladding. People have a right to feel safe in their homes and Government has a responsibility to act to make sure serious fire risks are addressed.",Labour,Facebook,7,2017,07/2017,2017/07,J) Labour,#N/A,Cladding
