In Britain, migrants and refugees are being scapegoated for the effects of austerity, while EU nationals are used as bargaining chips in Brexit negotiations.

The whipping up of anti-Muslim hysteria in the press has led to a dramatic rise in Islamophobic attacks in the wake of terror attacks in London and Manchester, with visible Muslim women the primary target.

Rampant institutional racism is being felt through a spate of deaths in police custody, the tragedy at Grenfell and systematic discrimination in employment and Hosuing.

Meanwhile In Europe, the rise of the Freedom Party in Austria, Front National in France and AfD in Germany are signs of a resurgence of the far right which requires a serious and coordinated effort to turn...",,,1.6404494382022472

You can read my next one in this week's paper, which is out now. I would like to wish you all a very happy New Year. As we begin 2018, it is natural to look back on the year we have had – and what a year of ups and downs 2017 has been. I think when we look back on 2017 in years to come, we will remember the horrific terror attacks which shook our country – including one right on our doorsteps at Manchester Arena. We will never forget the images we saw and the stories we read of these awful attacks and we will never forget the families who lost children and parents. It is difficult to imagine that they will have just spent their first Christmas without their loved ones. At least nine terror attacks have been foiled by police and security services in our country this year.

It seeks to make sure homes are fit for human habitation at the start of a tenancy and all the way throughout. This means that if a landlord is failing to take action over poor conditions in a property, the renter has the right to take them to court.

“Not one penny to fit sprinklers to Birmingham’s 230 tower blocks from Government,” said Jack Dromey MP for the #Birmingham constituency of #Erdington.

“Now the city is suffering the biggest cuts in local government history is to suffer a further £100 million unfair funding cuts,” added the The Labour Party MP.

“Yet Maidenhead is the constituency the least hard-hit of any in Britain.

“How can the Prime Minister begin to justify one law for her own constituency and another law for the great city of Birmingham?”

Unlike many of his peers, Corbyn was lucky enough to have never swallowed the pill of neoliberalism, while many of today’s younger generation, and those left behind by globalisation, have never seen the appeal. The zeitgeist has now shifted and with instances like Grenfell, people increasingly feel it in their bones that system change is desperately needed; these are the foundations for a Corbyn-led Labour government.""",http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/chris-williamson/grenfell-fire_b_18096158.html,,The Grenfell Tower Tragedy Represents A Fork In The Road For Our Society,"Tony Benn said famously in an interview that ""every generation must fight the same battles again and again.

Despite those cuts, the council is working hard to reassure people in high rises. The council is desperate to do more but simply does not have the money.

I was also horrified to discover that the Tenant Management Organisation, tasked with maintaining the building, had covered the block with a combustible cladding that is thought to have been responsible for the fire being so deadly. The Prime minister has since confirmed that the same material has been used for cladding in other tower blocks elsewhere in the country. Yesterday, I pressed the Theresa May to commit to taking concrete steps to make sure that any discovery of combustible cladding on tower blocks, similar to the cladding that added to the tragic scale of the Grenfell Tower fire, around the county will be dealt with as a matter of extreme urgency.

I drove past it on my way out of London last week and to see the burnt out wreck of that building – a building that was home to hundreds of families and households – is to begin to understand the horror of that night when it burnt down. The news reports and images of that night, and the stories of the many personal tragedies that unfolded, are the stuff of nightmares. The stories of the actions of emergency services, the many, many individuals that acted as heroes helping their neighbours, and the rallying round by the wider community to help, are a tribute to the basic human nature that sees people behave in completely unselfish ways when called upon to help.

This week I witnessed first-hand in Kensington the justifiable anger of the local community, and spent time talking with and listening to local residents affected. Today was a crucial opportunity for me to make clear to the Government what the community have told me they need, both right now and in the longer term as they recover from this devastating fire. I made a number of points at the meeting and have highlighted below the five main points: Firstly - at the meeting I raised the need for clearer direction on the ground for those affected of how and where they can access support services, ranging from housing and financial support to counselling. This means highly visibly expert people in the community helping local residents access help. There must be better outreach work. Secondly, I stressed just how crucial it is the rehousing efforts are speeded up and...",,,,,,,-1.0708582834331337

I have paused before commenting because of there has been a huge amount of speculation on social media and in the mainstream media, I didn't want to add to that. The Prime Minister was right to call for an enquiry to run in parallel with the fire service investigation. Clearly something (or things) went very badly wrong and we need to find out promptly what happened in case emergency remedial action needs to be taken in other similar high rise buildings.

Dear Prime Minister, I spent several hours yesterday talking to local residents around Grenfell Tower. These were difficult conversations with a tight-knit community that is understandably distraught, frustrated and increasingly angry. They feel the Government and local council haven’t done enough to help them in the aftermath of this horrific incident, or to provide answers to their increasingly urgent questions. I promised the local community that I would fight for them to get the support and answers they deserve as quickly as possible. I am therefore writing to you today to set out the action that I believe the Government needs to take, as a matter of urgency.

Here in Brighton & Hove, I've been told the council has already committed to a review of fire safety in its housing stock, which is reassuring. However, many residents are placed by the local authority in private rented property, so I think the review should be extended to include all properties, including those used for emergency and temporary accommodation - and I've stressed this again to them this week.

The operation is now shifting from the search and rescue phase to the recovery phase. Under these circumstances the full scale of the tragedy is becoming clear and there are pressing questions, which demand urgent answers. That's why I've demanded a full, independent public inquiry into the fire at Grenfell Tower.
