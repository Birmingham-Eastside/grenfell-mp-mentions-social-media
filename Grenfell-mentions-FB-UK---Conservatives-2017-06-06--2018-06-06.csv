A challenging week once again. We provided officers to support the tragic events at Grenfell Tower and we are checking on their welfare.

We get many concerns raised around moped thefts and related crime so a more detailed update this week.

People living in high-rise buildings in Barnet will be worried about fire safety after these terrible events. I urged Barnet Council to take action and I welcome the work they are undertaking to re-examine fire safety in high-rise blocks to find out whether any of the problems which contributed to the Grenfell disaster are present in Barnet. The Council has also made a commitment to invest in new fire safety measures, taking advice from the Fire Brigade on what is needed, including sprinklers where necessary. I asked the Prime Minister a question urging other local authorities to do the same. It is important that the owners of privately-owned blocks also take action, particularly where cladding has taken place. I will be pressing them to do that.",https://www.facebook.com/theresavillierscb/videos/848430028648784/,,,,,,1.4634146341463414

More results will be made public in the next 48 hours. This was very concerning. My immediate thought, obviously, was for residents in Cheltenham. So, having spoken further to the county's Chief Fire Officer today, I can provide the following update: Cheltenham has zero high-rise buildings with similar cladding to Grenfell Tower. However, there are three medium-rise buildings that have been confirmed to use a different type of cladding, known as 'Rockwool'.

In response the the terrible fire and loss of life at Grenfell Tower a number of people have criticised me for voting against Labour's ""Homes Fit For Human Habitation Bill"". They highlight my parliamentary declaration of interests showing that I was a private landlord and imply (or state) that I did so out of financial self interest. Almost every element of those accusations is untrue. I don't usually respond to baseless accusations but this one is particularly pernicious and is being linked to the tragedy at Grenfell Tower. So in this instance I think it deserves a response. The bill that I am accused of voting down was in fact a Labour amendment to the government's Housing and Planning Bill.
