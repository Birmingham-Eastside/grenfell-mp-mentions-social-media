THT tell me costings are being obtained for new fire safety measures, and assessments being carried out on all tower blocks. I am assured the findings will be shared with residents. I also understand that new liaison arrangements with residents are being put in place. In the meantime, the advice to residents remains to stay put in your flat in the event of a fire, but that will be reviewed to see if any change to the advice is necessary. Fire safety was also discussed in parliament this morning, when the prime minister made a statement to MPs.

The absolute horror of the Grenfell Tower fire make any words empty and inadequate. I could hardly watch the devastating scenes from the catastrophe. So much pain and suffering. A manmade, seemingly preventable disaster in 21st century Britain at the heart of one of London’s richest boroughs. The agonising grief of a community let down and the amazing heroism of emergency services personnel contrasted with the flatfooted response of national and local Government. Of course everyone living in tower blocks all over the country will be anxious about their own safety now and understandably so. I was reassured to be contacted by Ongo who have the Crosby and Trent View House Flats to be told they were tacking immediate steps to reassure tenants. One of my priorities this week is to double check this. We seem to be in a time of awful events coming from nowhere with yet another suspected terrorist attack reported this morning.
